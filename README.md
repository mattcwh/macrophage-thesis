# Example codes for analysis performed in my thesis

### What is this repository for?

I have generated many codes throughout my PhD to analyse bulk transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, metabolomics and other experimental data. My thesis was on the topic of `Dynamic Regulation of Tissue-Resident Macrophage Function: Immune Crosstalk, Microbiome, and Scavenger Receptor Metabolic Sensing`. However, I do not have the right to disclose the codes, and unfortunately, I am no longer involved in the development of the studies.

This repository contains some example codes to demonstrate the work I have done during my studies, without disclosing the data or any unique analytic strategies.

### Who do I talk to?

I have a lot more experience writing codes for creative analysis and visualisation in my full-time job as a Bioinformatician at Sonrai Analytics.

### Showcases

This is irrelevant to the thesis, but if you're interested, I have analysed single-cell RNAseq data and produced interactive R Shiny Apps visualisations during my PhD for other labs.
